# Ecommerce-Data-Management-System

### Summary:
E-commerce is a major source of data these days. Millions of orders are being place and delivered each day. The following project “E-Commerce Data Management System” can be looked at as a proof of concept (POC) about managing the e-commerce data and using it for analytical purposes at a large scale.

### Problem Statement:
Prior to the development of the internet, customers had to physically visit a store to make
purchases, but this is no longer the case. People can now purchase goods online from the comfort
of their homes. This has resulted in the expansion of the e-commerce market. Due to this, tons of
data are produced and stored every second. Modern information technology is required to manage
this e-commerce system due to the growing number of people engaging in electronic commerce.
The e-commerce sector depends heavily on databases, and in the current environment, an ecommerce
company's performance is directly related to how well it has optimized its database and
so, efficient data management is crucial. Along with it, identifying trends and relevant conclusions
from the data is also very important to beat the competition. This problem can be resolved with
the aid of an effective eCommerce database management system in which the data is organized in
a proper format, which helps in accessing data more efficiently by e-commerce applications.
Furthermore, Ecommerce Analytics helps you determine the volume of sales of a particular
product and understand the buying trends of the customers/users which will be helpful in building
a recommendation system. We can keep track of inventory, track the products that are going out
of stock and restock them well in advance.

### Goal:
The goal of this E-Commerce Data Management system is to showcase managing of retail data
and utilizing the data for analytical purposes.

### Requirements:
• MySQL workbench 
• MongoDB Compass
• Jupyter Notebook (Python)

### Summary and recommendation:
Customers no longer need to physically visit a store to make purchases, thanks to the emergence
of the internet. Nowadays, consumers may shop online from the convenience of their homes. The
market for online shopping has grown as a result. As a result, massive amounts of data are
generated and stored every second. Due to the increasing number of people using electronic
commerce, modern information technology is needed to handle this e-commerce system. The ecommerce
industry relies significantly on databases; hence, effective data management is essential.
In the current context, an e-commerce company's profitability is directly connected to how well it
has optimized its database. Additionally, it involves seeing patterns and drawing pertinent
inferences from the data.

### Future Scope:
• The model can be extended with the usage of ML algorithms to significantly improve
personalized recommendation of products to the customers.
• The smart image recognition system can be implemented with the help of image
recognition techniques for searching of the products.
